CodeZone Starter Theme
======================

Hi. I'm a starter theme for use in CodeZone projects.

Installation
---------------

### Setup

First, you need to install the necessary Node.js and Composer dependencies:

```sh
$ composer install
$ npm install
```

### Asset Compilation

The theme comes preloaded with Laravel Mix and Tailwind CSS.

- `npx mix` : Compiles CSS and JS for development.
- `npx mix watch` : Watches for changes while you work.
- `npx mix --production` : Compiles CSS and JS for production.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
